# chart-harvest
A trade only happens when you disagree with the market. chart-harvest helps identify market opportunities.  
  
Currently, I trudge through many charts a week looking at possible setups for resistance and support zones in stock charts. This is a very time consuming process that around 30% of the time ends up being unecessary due to lack of buying power, stock and option illiquidity, wide option strike prices, wide bid-asks or is a statistically boring stock. This project looks to expand the range of symbols I follow while reducing the overhead needed to add it to my watchlist. This will help identify more market opportunities to apply various option strategies on. After that, I would like to implement a dashboard. This view might be composed of: a description, company financials, stock and option volume, and an inline chart.

TODO:
1. Init mockup of site
2. Rough outline of stock finidng alogirthm
3. Build ticker dashboard
4. Finish algorithm
5. Push algoirthm output onto site

Identification of a *mispriced* stock will be left to a human.
