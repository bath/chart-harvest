# chart-harvest
A trade only happens when you disagree with the market. chart-harvest helps identify market opportunities.  
  
Currently, I trudge through many charts a week looking at possible setups for resistance and support zones in selected stocks I have been following. chart-harvest looks to expand the range of symbols I follow to help identify market opportunities to apply on various option strategies on. You can then view the a selected stock in a dashboard with a description, company financials, stock and option volume, and chart.
  
Although I only trade high probabilty of profit options, I hope to support:
- Spreads
  - Debit
  - Credit
  - Calendar
- Straddle
- Strangle
- Butterfly
- Iron Condor
